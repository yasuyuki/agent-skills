# Handing work to a human

Apply this skill even when the user asks only for a command and no "please run"
or handoff heading is needed. A request for instructions is not authorization to
perform the requested action instead of showing it.

Finish the authorized machine work before handing over the part that requires
the person. Use available tools to resolve facts and routine choices yourself.
Check a plausible CLI or API when it could remove a manual step; do not broaden
the task into installing tools, changing permissions, or handling credentials
just to avoid asking. Respect sandbox and authorization boundaries.

Ask only for missing input that materially affects the result, required approval,
or an action the available tools cannot perform. Existing authorization remains
valid; do not ask for it again. Continue independent work while waiting.

Give the smallest remaining action, its execution context, and what success
looks like. Start from the person's current host and screen, using available
evidence and existing entry-point documentation. Do not assume a target input
field or terminal is already open: include the steps to open the application,
connect to the target environment, and reach the input, as needed, in execution
order with the visible success state for each step. Reuse an already open,
connected session instead of restarting it. If the starting state is unknown,
make those setup steps conditional; ask only when the uncertainty prevents a
usable handoff. Distinguish checking the written procedure from observing the
actual screen or successfully completing the action.

Relaying a request to another environment's agent is a human action when the
person must carry it. Name the receiving environment and provide the exact text
to paste, separately from the instructions to the person. Include the receiving
environment in the payload itself, so it survives forwarding without the
surrounding explanation. Include necessary URLs
as literal text inside the copyable payload, not only hyperlink attributes.
For an environment-routed request, the payload must also name the concrete
environment and logical runtime principal, its existing entry point, requested
approval/sandbox mode, acceptance risk, material exclusions or forbidden
operations, capability evidence, and any unknown condition.  Do not infer those
facts from a shared distro, OS label, or an environment's active state, and do
not describe a contract-changing environment modification as preparation. Keep
the requested approval/sandbox mode distinct from the recipient's observed
effective mode. Risk accepted inside the named environment does not extend to
its host or another environment.
Use a plain-text code block without quote prefixes or list decorations that the
person must remove. Do not ask them to reconstruct references or edit the request.
Keep shared-task content and state under the `handoff` rule when available; this
skill governs the human relay, not an additional task ledger.

Commands, relayed requests and their references must survive the actual display
and copy-paste path, not merely parse as the original text. Console or harness wrapping can insert real
whitespace, even inside a quoted argument: `workspace-write` can become
`workspace- write`. A fenced one-line command alone does not prevent this.

When a command is long or the user reports wrapping, split it at syntactically
valid boundaries. Prefer existing short entrypoints, entering the target shell
and directory first, or native argument arrays with separate short elements.
Keep each option, path, and quoted value intact. Include the full WSL/SSH/container
prefix when assessing length. Do not rely on backslash/backtick continuations or
ask the user to repair wrapped text. Check the longest displayed line against
the known display constraint; if the width is unknown, shorten the invocation
without inventing a universal width guarantee.

When the remaining procedure amounts to a script (for example, checks sharing
variables, branching, or coordinated failure handling), reuse an existing entry
point or save and validate a script file before handing it over. Do not present
the script body as a copy-paste procedure, including a heredoc or encoded payload
that makes the user recreate the file. Keep ordinary short commands as commands.
Create a script only when needed and allowed; respect a no-new-scripts request.

Put the file where the intended user can access it within existing permissions.
If transfer is needed, provide a way to retrieve just that file, using a fixed
revision when retrieving from a repository, followed by a separate short execution
command. Do not require a repository clone just to obtain the script or pipe a
download directly into a shell. Verify the saved file, the available retrieval
path, and the target shell; state the working directory, success output and
failure behavior. Distinguish a validated handoff from execution by its recipient.

Before adding a script-like handoff, check whether the existing ordinary entry
point can perform the work. Do not retain an unnecessary workaround as code.
Record an unresolved cause only when it threatens a required outcome, data
protection, or recovery with substantial human monitoring, approval waits or
repeated work. Reuse the designated task or established issue tracker; do not
create an issue or handoff update solely because a manual step may recur or an
easily recoverable problem occurred. Distinguish an observed failure from a
suspected cause, and do not expand the authorized repair scope. Keep any required
but unavailable recording pending in the existing handoff, without copying the
task's contract or results into a second ledger.

Validate the exact presented syntax in the stated shell and use a safe dry run
or version query through the same argument path where available. Syntax checks
do not prove that copying from the UI preserves bytes. For relayed text, check
that plain-text copying retains the request and literal URLs without manual
removal of decoration; a code block's appearance alone is not proof. Report
format inspection, observed copy/paste, recipient retrieval and execution as
separate evidence. If the actual UI path is unavailable, leave that check pending. Never execute a destructive
or externally visible action merely to test the user's command.

If a result is needed, ask for the specific non-sensitive output or pass/fail.
Never request tokens, passwords, or private data in chat. Follow the applicable
`session-end-user-work` rule for final-response formatting.
