Read [pstack-runtime](../pstack-runtime/SKILL.md) before this workflow. Its native capability, settings, permission and lifecycle contract governs every referenced playbook.


# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

## Step 1. Assess Complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. One explainer explores and explains in a single pass. Go to Step 2b.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): spawn parallel explorers first, then hand off to the explainer. Go to Step 2a.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

Use the native delegation and role settings contract in [pstack-runtime](../pstack-runtime/SKILL.md).

## Step 2a. Explore (complex questions only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 exploration angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Delegate the independent explorers through the actual native schema:

Use the configured how-explorer role or explicit parent inheritance. State read-only scope in the self-contained prompt; select only parameters exposed by the current native tool.

Each explorer gets the prompt in `references/explorer-prompt.md` with its angle filled in. Then go to Step 3.

## Step 2b. Direct Explain (simple questions)

Delegate one read-only explainer that explores and explains in one pass:

Use the configured how-explainer role or explicit parent inheritance. State read-only scope in the self-contained prompt; select only parameters exposed by the current native tool.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to Step 4.

## Step 3. Synthesize (complex questions only)

Once explorer results have been retrieved through the native result API, delegate one read-only explainer to synthesize them:

Use the configured how-explainer role or explicit parent inheritance. State read-only scope in the self-contained prompt; select only parameters exposed by the current native tool.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` with every explorer's findings filled in.

## Step 4. Present

Present the explainer's output to the user. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output Format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
