# Swarm

Fan out necessary independent native workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker model from `swarm workers` in the pstack settings file when present (the matching private pstack-settings reference selected by pstack-runtime). Otherwise use `inherit-parent`. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn workers through the actual native tools and settings defined in pstack-runtime. Scope outputs through existing registered workspace ownership; unsupported required capabilities are BLOCKED.

Use only existing authorized launch and workspace registration routes; do not invent vendor parameters or unmanaged worktrees.

Use the native delegation and role settings contract in [pstack-runtime](../pstack-runtime/SKILL.md).

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
