Read [pstack-runtime](../pstack-runtime/SKILL.md) before this workflow. Its native capability, settings, permission and lifecycle contract governs every referenced playbook.


# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

The parent finds its own transcript file before fanning out. Use only the active workspace's transcript directory. Never glob across every project's directory. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects.

Where the transcript lives depends on your harness:

- **Cursor:** the system prompt names the active workspace's `agent-transcripts/` directory. Use that path.

  ```bash
  ls -t <agent-transcripts>/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/*.jsonl <agent-transcripts>/*/subagents/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -10
  ```

  Three transcript layouts: legacy flat (`<id>.jsonl`), current nested (`<id>/<id>.jsonl`), and subagent (`<parent>/subagents/<child>.jsonl`).
- **Claude Code:** `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`, where `<slug>` is the workspace path with every character that isn't a letter or digit turned into "-".
- **Pi:** `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<slug>--/*.jsonl`, where `<slug>` is the workspace path with the leading slash dropped and each "/" turned into "-".
- **Codex:** `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl`. Keep only files whose first line has `payload.cwd` equal to the workspace path.
- **Other harnesses:** check the harness's session directory for this workspace.

Take the newest candidates first. Confirm a candidate by finding the conversation's opening user prompt in its first user message. Take the matching path. If no path resolves, write a tight digest of the session and pass that instead.

### 2. Spawn necessary independent reviewers

Choose independent lenses needed for acceptance, using the configured roles or explicit parent inheritance. Native calls and read-only access follow pstack-runtime; MCP availability does not grant write authority.

Use the native delegation and role settings contract in [pstack-runtime](../pstack-runtime/SKILL.md).

| Lens | `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | your configured reflect-judgment model (default `inherit-parent`) | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | your configured reflect-tooling model (default `inherit-parent`) | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | your configured reflect-judgment model (default `inherit-parent`) | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Retrieve reviewer findings through the actual native result API, as defined in pstack-runtime.

### 3. Synthesize

Use the configured reflect-judgment role or parent inheritance with native calls and read-only responsibilities from pstack-runtime. Spot-verify citations through authorized read-only access. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

Record Backlog items in the existing task Issue/source of truth only when explicit authority already covers that write. Otherwise report them to the user without creating or writing a tracker. Accepted edits retain the approval boundary above.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to your harness's skill-authoring skill and run its draft / test / iterate loop. That is `create-skill` in Cursor (built in) or Anthropic's `skill-creator`. If you have neither, follow the Agent Skills format at agentskills.io. "`create-skill`" below means whichever of these you use.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `create-skill` and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via create-skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `create-skill`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog recorded with existing explicit authority: actual task Issue reference. Otherwise list unfiled findings.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
